Judging by the below given schema:

//Books
{
	ISBN : 12,
	author : ["X", "Y"], 
	keywords : ["X", "Y"], 
	isBorrowed : true, 
	borrowedBy : {}, 
	returnDate : Date()
}

//Users
{
	userName : "", 
	password : "", 
	email : "",
	userRole : "std/librarian"
}


If we are to search books by keywords, then its better to apply a multikey index on its keywords attribute. We can also consider applying index on its ISBN.
